Q1:
Medical researchers have developed a new artificial heart constructed primarily of titanium and plastic. The heart will last and operate almost indefinitely once it is implanted in the patientâ€™s body,but the battery pack needs to be recharged about every four hours. A random sample of 50 battery packs is selected and subjected to a life test. The average life of these batteries is 4.05 hours. Assume that battery life is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.2 hour.Is there evidence to support the claim that the mean battery life exceeds 4 hours? Use $\alpha = 0.01$ and $\alpha = 0.05$.

Q2.Two different formulations of an oxygenated motor fuel are being tested to study their road octane numbers. The variance of road octane number for formulation-1 is 1.5, and for formulation-2 it is 1.2.Two random samples of size n1 = 35 and n2 = 40 are tested, and the mean road octane numbers observed are 89.6 and 92.5. Assume normality,\\
(a) Construct a 95\% two-sided confidence interval on the difference in mean road octane number.\\ 
(b) If formulation 2 produces a higher road octane number than formulation 1, the manufacturer would like to detect it. Formulate and test an appropriate hypothesis, using $\alpha = 0.10$ and $\alpha = 0.05$.\\

Conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The 95\% Confidence Interval for the difference in means $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$ is \textbf{\boldmath$(-3.429, -2.371)$}.  
    \item At both significance levels $\alpha = 0.10$ and $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.  
    \item This provides strong evidence that Formulation 2 has a significantly higher road octane number than Formulation 1.

Q3. A random sample of 500 registered voters in Bangalore is asked if they favor the use of oxygenated fuels year-round to reduce air pollution. If more than 400 voters respond positively, we will conclude that at least 60\% of the voters favor the use of these fuels.Find the probability of type I error if exactly 60\% of the voters favor the use of these fuels.

Q4. A random sample of 500 adult residents of Maricopa County ound that 385 were in favor of increasing the highway speed limit to 75 mph, while another sample of 400 adult residents of Pima Country found that 267 were in favor of the increased speed limit. Do these data indicate that there is a difference in the support for increasing the speed limit between the residents of the two countries? Use  alpha =0.05. What is the P-value for this test?
<<>>=
# Null hypothesis H0: p1=p2
# Alternative Hypothesis H1: p1!=p2

# Given data
x <- c(385, 267)   # Favoring in Maricopa and Pima
n <- c(500, 400)   # Sample sizes

# Perform a two-proportion test (Chi-squared approximation)
test_result <- prop.test(x, n, alternative = "two.sided", correct = FALSE)

# Print results
cat("Chi-squared Test Statistic:", test_result$statistic, "\n")
cat("P-value:", test_result$p.value, "\n")

# Decision at alpha = 0.05
if (test_result$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("At alpha = 0.05, we reject H0. There is a significant
difference in support for the speed limit increase.\n")
} else {
  cat("At alpha = 0.05, we fail to reject H0. No significant
difference in support between the counties.\n")
}
@
Conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The computed p-value is \textbf{0.0006264947}.
    \item Since the p-value is less than the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, we \textbf{reject the null hypothesis} $H_0$.
    \item This indicates that there is a \textbf{significant difference} in support for the speed limit increase between the two counties.
